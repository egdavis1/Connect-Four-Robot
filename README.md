# Connect-Four-Robot

This code plays a game of connect four against a user using sensors and motors from a Lego EV3 Robot as well as robotC code.
This was a group project done by Emma Davis, Stefanson Nelson, Alexandar Stenberg, and Edward Wang.

The code includes testing of all functions of the robot to ensure the robot is working correctly before a game of Connect Four can be played.
